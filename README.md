# Dashboard for Customer Support Team - Technical Support Ticket Analysis

## Overview
This project involves creating a comprehensive Tableau dashboard for the Customer Support team, which handles various issues and requests from users. The goal is to monitor the team's performance and ensure that all tickets are processed efficiently, customer satisfaction is maintained, and workload is balanced across the teams.

## Project Goals
1. Monitor the number and status of tickets in real-time.
2. Analyze the total number of open tickets and their severity.
3. Track the average ticket resolution time and compare it to the KPI of 17.5 days.
4. Measure the percentage of satisfied customers after ticket closure against the KPI of 45%.
5. Identify teams with the highest number of open tickets and potential backlog issues.
6. Provide insights on weekly ticket dynamics, including new and open tickets, resolution time, and customer satisfaction trends.
7. Highlight open tickets with high severity for priority action by team managers.
